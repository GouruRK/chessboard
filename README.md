# Chessboard

This is a work in progress chessboard using HTML / CSS / JS

## Already done

* Load and create FENs
* Display the board
* Display the pieces
* Move the pieces using drag and drop html propreties
* Move pieces according to their legals moves
* Capture other pieces
* 'En passant'
* Castle
* The concept of 'check' (or when a square is under attack)

## To do

* Use the [Draggable API](https://github.com/Shopify/draggable) to remove the natural opacity of elements when drag
* Remove legals moves if the king is under attack
* Display a message when checkmate or when the game is a draw
* Allowing the user to choose a promotion
